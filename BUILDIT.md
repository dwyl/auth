This is a log 
of the steps taken 
to build the **`auth`** Application. üöÄ <br />
It took us _weeks_ 
to write it,
but you can 
[***speedrun***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrun)
it in **30 minutes**. üèÅ

# TODO: fill-in the gaps during the [Rebuild `#207`](https://github.com/dwyl/auth/issues/207)

For now I'm just adding the parts that are being added to the "old"
version of **`auth`** so that we can _easily_ re-create them in the re-build.

# ERD `before` adding `groups`

The database Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
had the following tables/relationships 
_before_ we added `groups`:

![erd-before-groups](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/195663957-665e6064-32df-4366-89ed-c2dc109f79a6.png)


# 10. Groups

Our objective with **`groups`** 
is to enable **`people`** 
to invite others 
to ***collaborate***.

Our reasoning to include **`groups`**
in the **`auth`** App 
is that it _already_ stores all **`people`** related
(_personally identifiable_) data
in therefore _grouping_ 
those **`people`** together makes logical sense.

This is a **_generalised_ implementation**
that can be used by **_any_ application**
that requires collaboration/teamwork.

> **Note**: we are fully aware 
> that having **`people`** and **`groups`**
> in the **`auth`** App presents
> both a _technical_ and UX/UI challenge.
> It would be _much_ simpler from the _individual_
> App's perspective to store `people` and `groups`
> in the App's DB 
> and _not_ have to connect to another App
> to retrieve and manage them.
> Luckily (for us) there is a **_widely_ accepted/practiced**
> application architecture called
> [***Microservices***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)
> where this approach to logical
> [**separation of concerns**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns)
> is ***embraced***.
> We _know_ this _initially_ introduces some complexity into our App architecture.
> But we hope that by reading on you will see that it 
> **_significantly_ simplifies** the "consuming" app.

## 10.1 Create Schema

First we need to create a new schema for storing the data.

Run the folloiwng 
[**`mix phx.gen.schema`**](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.Schema.html)
command to create the `groups` schema
as outlined in 
[**`#220`**](https://github.com/dwyl/auth/issues/220)

```sh
mix phx.gen.schema Group groups name:binary desc:binary kind:integer 
```

Both `group.name` and `group.desc` (description)
are considered personally identifiable or sensitive information
hence using the `binary` type in the `gen.schema` command.
The data for these fields will be encrypted at rest using 
[`Fields.Encrypted`](https://github.com/dwyl/fields).

The `group.kind` will be the way people _categorise_ 
their various groups. It will be an `Enum` 
and therefore the `integer` will be stored in the DB.


## 10.2 _Test_ Groups Schema

Having created the `groups` schema & migration 
in the previous step,
a new file was created: 
`lib/auth/group.ex`

If we run the coverage report with the command: `mix c`

We see that there are 
**no tests** for the code in the `group.ex` file:

```sh
----------------
COV    FILE                                        LINES RELEVANT   MISSED
100.0% lib/auth.ex                                     9        0        0

100.0% lib/auth_web/views/role_view.ex                10        3        0
[TOTAL]  99.3%
----------------
```

That's what we are fixing now.

Create a new file with the path:
`test/auth/group_test.exs`

Add the following code:

```elixir
defmodule Auth.GroupTest do
  use Auth.DataCase, async: true

  describe "Group Schema Tests" do
    test "Auth.Group.create/1 creates a new group" do
      group = %{
        desc: "My test group",
        name: "TestGroup",
        kind: 1
      }
      assert {:ok, inserted_group} = Auth.Group.create(group)
      assert inserted_group.name == group.name
    end
  end
end
```

If you invoke this test:

```sh
mix test test/auth/group_test.exs
```

You will see it _fail_. 
That's because the `Auth.Group.create/1` does not yet _exist_.
Crete it in the 
`lib/auth/group.ex`
file:

```elixir
  @doc """
  Creates a `group`.
  """
  def create(attrs) do
    %Group{}
    |> changeset(attrs)
    |> Repo.insert()
  end
```

Rememer to add the following aliases to the top of the file:
```elixir
  alias Auth.{Repo}
  alias __MODULE__
```
That will give us access to the `Repo.insert/1` function
and `alias __MODULE__` just means 
"alias the _current_ file so that I can use it below".
e.g: `%Group{}` the schema defined in this file.

When you re-run the test:

```sh
mix test test/auth/group_test.exs
```

It should pass.

If you re-run the tests with coverage:

```sh
mix c
```

You should see the coverage back up to 100%:

```sh
----------------
COV    FILE                                        LINES RELEVANT   MISSED
100.0% lib/auth.ex                                     9        0        0
100.0% lib/auth/group.ex                              31        3        0 <-- 100%
100.0% lib/auth/init/init.ex                         124       26        0
... etc.
[TOTAL] 100.0%
----------------
```

There is still another schema 
we need to create for `groups`,
namely `group_members` 
that will allow us to add `people` to a `group`.
But let's build some UI _first_
so that we can _see_ it coming to life!

## 10.3 Create `LiveView` for `groups`

Create the `lib/auth_web/live` directory
and the controller at `lib/auth_web/live/groups_live.ex`:

```elixir
defmodule AuthWeb.GroupsLive do
  use AuthWeb, :live_view

  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
    {:ok, socket}
  end
end
```

Create the `lib/auth_web/views/groups_view.ex` file:

```elixir
defmodule AuthWeb.GroupsLiveView do
  use AuthWeb, :view
end
```

Next, create the
**`lib/auth_web/live/groups_live.html.heex`**
file 
and add the following line of `HTML`:

```html
<h1 class="">Groups LiveView!</h1>
```

Finally, to make the **root layout** simpler, 
open the 
`lib/auth_web/templates/layout/live.html.heex`
file and 
update the contents of the `<body>` to:

```html
<body>
  <header>
    <section class="container">
      <h1>App Name Here</h1>
    </section>
  </header>
  <%= @inner_content %>
</body>
```

## 10.4 Update `router.ex`

Now that you've created the necessary files,
open the router
and add a new route `/groups` 
pointing to our newly created `GroupsLive` controller


```elixir
scope "/", AuthWeb do
  pipe_through :browser
  pipe_through :auth

  # ... existing routes ...

  live "/groups", GroupsLive # <-- New!
end
```

Now if you refresh the page 
you should see the following:

# TODO: Add Screenshot of Groups Live Page!

![liveveiw-page-with-tailwind-style](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/176137805-34467c88-add2-487f-9593-931d0314df62.png)



<hr /> next ...


## 10.5 Update Tests

At this point we have made a few changes 
that mean our automated test suite will no longer pass ... 
Run the tests in your command line with the following command:

```sh
mix test
```

You should see the tests fail:

```sh
..

  1) test GET / (AppWeb.PageControllerTest)
     test/app_web/controllers/page_controller_test.exs:4
     Assertion with =~ failed
     code:  assert html_response(conn, 200) =~ "Hello TailWorld!"
     left:  "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">
     <main class=\"container\">
     <h1 class=\"text-6xl text-center\">LiveView App Page!</h1>\n</main></div>
     </body>\n</html>"
     right: "Hello TailWorld!"
     stacktrace:
       test/app_web/controllers/page_controller_test.exs:6: (test)

Finished in 0.1 seconds (0.06s async, 0.1s sync)
3 tests, 1 failure
```

Create a new directory: `test/app_web/live`

Then create the file: 
`test/app_web/live/app_live_test.exs`

With the following content:

```elixir
defmodule AppWeb.AppLiveTest do
  use AppWeb.ConnCase

  test "GET /", %{conn: conn} do
    conn = get(conn, "/")
    assert html_response(conn, 200) =~ "LiveView App Page!"
  end
end
```

Save the file 
and re-run the tests: `mix test`

You should see output similar to the following:

```sh
Generated app app
The database for App.Repo has been dropped
...

Finished in 0.1 seconds (0.08s async, 0.1s sync)
3 tests, 0 failures

Randomized with seed 796477
```




## 10.6 Group _Members_

Now that we have groups
