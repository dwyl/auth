-- The purpose of this file is to have a list of working SQL Queries
-- that we can use to inspect the data in the DB.
-- I still find "raw" SQL to be easier to read/reason about than Ecto

-- select distinct people with status.text
SELECT DISTINCT ON (l.person_id, l.app_id)
l.id, l.app_id, l.person_id, l.updated_at,
st.text as status
  FROM logs l
  JOIN status as st on l.status_id = st.id

SELECT DISTINCT ON (l.person_id, l.app_id)
l.id, l.app_id, l.person_id, l.updated_at,
st.text as status
  FROM logs l
  JOIN status as st on l.status_id = st.id
  ORDER BY l.inserted_at

-- GROUP BY
SELECT person_id, app_id
FROM logs
GROUP BY person_id, app_id;

-- try adding status (FAILS)
SELECT person_id, app_id, status_id
FROM logs
GROUP BY (person_id, app_id);
-- ERROR:  column "logs.status_id" must appear in the GROUP BY clause

-- with the number of logs for that person:
SELECT person_id, app_id, count(*) AS count
FROM logs
GROUP BY person_id, app_id;

-- attempt JOIN in subquery:
SELECT * FROM (

  FROM logs l
  ORDER BY l.person_id, l.inserted_at DESC
) t
ORDER BY inserted_at DESC

-- This works!!

  ORDER BY person_id, inserted_at DESC
) l
JOIN status as st on l.status_id = st.id
